            What is Lorem Ipsum?
        </h3>
        <p class="qizil">
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>
            specimen book.
        </p>
        <p class="green center katta">
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="green">
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br>
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br>
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br>

        <h3>
            Where does it come from?
        </h3>
        <p class="green">
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots <br>
            in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="qizil">
            Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, <br>
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br>
            passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, <br>
            discovered the undoubtable source.
